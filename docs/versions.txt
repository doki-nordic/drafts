#### List of versions ####
#
# Semantic versioning applies with small additions that allows versioning
# of the latest development version:
#  1. MINOR version is increased by two (even numbers only), e.g. 1.0.x, 1.2.x,
#     1.4.x, 1.6.x.
#  2. For latest development version, we use odd MINOR version with "99" as
#     PATCH version, e.g. 1.3.99 is latest development version that comes
#     after 1.2.x.
#
# Release check list:
#  1. Create a release commit:
#     a. Change version number in "hci_monitor_rtt.py".
#     b. If "help-latest.md" is different from newest "help-x.x.x.md", copy it.
#     c. Add new line to table in this file.
#     d. Increase latest development version in this file, if needed.
#     e. Change latest version in release notes.
#  3. Tag this commit with version "vX.Y.Z".
#  2. Create post-release commit:
#     a. Change version number in "hci_monitor_rtt.py" to "X.Y.99".
#     b. Add new section to release notes.
#  3. Push main branch and the new tag.
#  4. Create new release on github. Use new tag and "hci_monitor_rtt.py" file
#     from the tag (not the latest).
